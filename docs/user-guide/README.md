## Overview

The Ollama JupyterLab AI Assistant provides an intuitive interface to interact with Ollama's large language models directly within JupyterLab. The extension appears as a panel in the right sidebar of JupyterLab, allowing you to:

1. **Chat with AI**: Ask questions, get explanations, or request code examples
2. **Analyze Code**: Select a notebook cell and get an analysis of what the code does
3. **Improve Code**: Get suggestions to improve the code in a selected cell

The AI Assistant processes all requests locally using Ollama, ensuring your data remains private and secure.
