# JupyterLab AI Assistant - v1.1.2 Release Plans

This document outlines the issues and improvements needed for the v1.1.2 release, organized by component and priority level.

## Backend Issues

### Critical
- [ ] **Hard-coded Base URL**: Fix assumption that Ollama is running at `http://localhost:11434`, which breaks in Docker/containerized environments
- [ ] **Environment Variable Support**: Add support for configuring Ollama connection via environment variables
- [ ] **Container Network Isolation**: Implement proper handling for containerized environments where localhost isn't accessible
- [x] **API Compatibility Handling**: Improve detection and handling of different Ollama API versions (Fixed XSRF token handling for proper API communication)
- [ ] **Memory Management**: Implement pagination or chunking for large responses to prevent OOM errors
- [x] **Input Validation**: Add proper sanitization and validation of user input before sending to backend

### Intermediate
- [ ] **Request Timeout Configuration**: Make the default 60-second timeout configurable for complex models
- [ ] **Proxy Support**: Add configuration for proxy settings if Ollama is behind a proxy
- [ ] **Windows Path Handling**: Fix potential issues with path separators on Windows systems
- [ ] **Authentication Support**: Add mechanism to authenticate with Ollama if configured with authentication
- [ ] **Error Message Improvement**: Make error messages more user-friendly when Ollama isn't running
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for API requests to prevent potential DoS attacks
- [ ] **Response Error Handling**: Improve user feedback for various error scenarios (like network issues)
- [ ] **Streaming Response Monitoring**: Add metrics for streaming response performance

### Later
- [ ] **Model Management**: Add UI for downloading or managing models directly
- [ ] **Model Metadata Caching**: Implement caching mechanism for model metadata to improve performance
- [ ] **Configuration Persistence**: Store user configuration preferences across sessions
- [ ] **Resource Monitoring**: Add monitoring for memory/CPU usage to prevent resource exhaustion
- [x] **Streaming Optimization**: Improve streaming response handling for better efficiency (Implemented proper XSRF token handling for streaming)
- [ ] **Logging Improvements**: Enhance logging with better sanitization of sensitive information
- [ ] **API Request Logging**: Implement comprehensive logging for API requests to aid debugging

## Frontend Issues

### Critical
- [x] **Menu Integration**: Add AI Assistant to the main menu and properly configure commands (Implemented dedicated AI Assistant menu)
- [ ] **Bootstrap Integration Conflicts**: Resolve CSS conflicts between Bootstrap and JupyterLab's native styling
- [ ] **Fixed Container Widths**: Replace hard-coded width values causing overflow on smaller screens
- [ ] **Theme Inconsistencies**: Fix hardcoded colors and inconsistent theme implementation
- [x] **JupyterLab Version Dependencies**: Reduce UI component dependencies on specific JupyterLab versions (Updated icon system for JupyterLab 4.x compatibility)
- [ ] **Race Conditions**: Fix potential race conditions in ChatWidget.tsx when updating message state
- [ ] **Interface Responsiveness**: Improve UI responsiveness on different screen sizes

### Intermediate
- [ ] **Loading States**: Implement clear loading states during long requests in chat interface
- [ ] **Message Throttling**: Add throttling for rapid message sending
- [ ] **Mobile Responsiveness**: Improve interface adaptability to very small screens
- [ ] **Markdown Rendering**: Enhance ChatMessage.tsx to handle all possible markdown features
- [ ] **Model Selection UX**: Add clear error messages when models are unavailable and persist selections
- [ ] **Memory Leaks**: Fix components that don't properly clean up event listeners and subscriptions
- [ ] **UI State Persistence**: Save user preferences for chat settings (model, temperature)
- [ ] **Responsive Design Improvements**: Better mobile/tablet support for the chat interface
- [ ] **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Add keyboard shortcuts for common AI assistant actions

### Later
- [ ] **Accessibility Improvements**:
  - [ ] Add ARIA attributes for screen readers
  - [ ] Implement keyboard navigation support
  - [ ] Ensure sufficient color contrast ratios for WCAG 2.1 compliance
- [ ] **Internationalization**:
  - [ ] Add support for localization of UI text
  - [ ] Implement right-to-left language support
  - [ ] Add proper date/time localization
- [ ] **UI Performance**:
  - [ ] Optimize CSS files with code splitting
  - [ ] Implement virtualization for long message lists
  - [ ] Improve efficiency of CSS animations
- [ ] **Browser Compatibility**:
  - [ ] Add fallbacks for CSS variables in older browsers
  - [ ] Implement polyfills for modern JavaScript features
  - [ ] Fix browser-specific CSS properties
