## 🔍 Current Issues

### 🛠️ Code Quality and Organization

1. **Naming Inconsistencies**:
   - [ X ] The `build-cheak.sh` script contains a typo ("cheak" instead of "check") which is also reflected in the virtual environment name.
   - [ X ] Consider renaming for consistency and correctness.

2. **TypeScript Configuration**:
   - [ ] Current TypeScript configuration has `"noImplicitAny": false`, `"strict": false`, and `"strictNullChecks": false`.
   - [ ] This reduces type safety and could lead to runtime errors that would be caught by stricter TypeScript settings.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - [ ] Current error handling in the Ollama client is basic and could be improved for better user feedback.
   - [ ] The fallback mechanism from chat API to generate API could use more robust error reporting.

4. **Documentation**:
   - [ ] Inline code documentation is inconsistent across the codebase.
   - [ ] User documentation appears to be primarily in README files without structured API docs.

### 🧩 Feature Gaps

1. **Limited Model Configuration Options**:
   - [ ] Basic temperature and context controls are implemented, but more advanced LLM parameters could be exposed.
   - [ ] No apparent support for system-wide prompt templates or configurations.

2. **Lack of Testing Infrastructure**:
   - [ ] No visible comprehensive test suite for backend or frontend components.
   - [ ] Missing integration tests for the full JupyterLab + Ollama workflow.

3. **Limited Feedback Mechanisms**:
   - [ ] No apparent user feedback collection for model responses.
   - [ ] No built-in way to report issues with model outputs.

## ✨ Improvement Suggestions

### 💻 Code Quality Enhancements

1. **Code Refactoring**:
   - [ ] Improve TypeScript type safety by enabling strict mode and fixing any resulting issues.
   - [ ] Separate UI components into smaller, more focused components with clear responsibilities.
   - [ ] Implement consistent error handling patterns across both frontend and backend.

2. **Build Process Improvements**:
   - [ ] Fix naming issues in build scripts.
   - [ ] Standardize the build process with better error reporting.
   - [ ] Implement automated linting and formatting as part of the build process.

3. **Testing Infrastructure**:
   - [ ] Add unit tests for Python backend components.
   - [ ] Implement Jest tests for React components.
   - [ ] Create integration tests for the full extension.
   - [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline configuration for automated testing.

### 🌟 Feature Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Model Integration**:
   - [ ] Support for more Ollama model parameters and configurations.
   - [ ] Add model parameter presets for different use cases (code generation, explanation, etc.).
   - [ ] Implement model output caching to improve performance.

2. **Improved User Experience**:
   - [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for common AI assistant operations.
   - [ ] Implement better progress indicators for long-running requests.
   - [ ] Create a more intuitive UI for model selection and configuration.
   - [ ] Support for saving and reusing conversation contexts.

3. **Advanced Code Analysis**:
   - [ ] Implement more sophisticated code analysis features (not just whole cell analysis).
   - [ ] Add support for multi-cell context inclusion.
   - [ ] Integrate with code quality tools and linters.

4. **Security Enhancements**:
   - [ ] Add configurable rate limiting for API requests.
   - [ ] Implement content filtering options.
   - [ ] Support for API authentication when connecting to non-local Ollama instances.

5. **Extensibility**:
   - [ ] Create plugin architecture to allow for custom AI actions.
   - [ ] Support for external model providers beyond Ollama.
   - [ ] Allow for custom prompt templates and specialized interactions.

### 📚 Documentation Improvements

1. **Code Documentation**:
   - [ ] Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to all TypeScript components.
   - [ ] Ensure all Python classes and functions have proper docstrings.
   - [ ] Document the architecture and data flow of the extension.

2. **User Documentation**:
   - [ ] Create detailed user guides with usage examples.
   - [ ] Add troubleshooting documentation for common issues.
   - [ ] Include visual guides and screenshots for UI interactions.

3. **Developer Documentation**:
   - [ ] Create comprehensive setup guides for development environments.
   - [ ] Document component architecture and extension points.
   - [ ] Provide examples for extending or customizing the extension.
